# Instagram-Photo-Resizer
A simple app that adds whitespace around a non-square image for an attractive Instagram layout. 

The photo is not cropped or stretched; whitespace is simply added to the top and bottom of the photo
to make an attractive square shape, allowing the entire image to be seen on an instagram page.

Take a look at the ViewController.swift and UIImageBorder.swift files to see the code

This app was made for the simple fact that I wanted to easily format my photos before posting on instagram, and
also because I wanted to try out making apps. Although quite simple, this is my first app.

I haven't tested the app with Portrait orientation photos, as all of my pictures are in landscape.
I predict that the outcome will not be desirable.
